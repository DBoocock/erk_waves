# Follow these instructions to install Chaste via Docker (see the TL;DR):

https://github.com/Chaste/chaste-docker?tab=readme-ov-file#tldr

# E.g. to install Docker for Ubuntu (22.04) follow steps 1-3:

https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/ubuntu/#install-docker-desktop

# After installing Docker you can launch it from the terminal (you might have to use sudo):

docker run -it --init --rm -v chaste_data:/home/chaste chaste/release:2021.1

# Once this has finished downloading you should have access to Chaste within your Docker terminal chaste@xxx:~$

# Download the erk_waves user project within this terminal:

cd projects
git clone https://github.com/DBoocock/erk_waves.git
cd erk_waves
# Run setup (only requires yes for cell-based component)
python setup_project.py
# Copy the python scripts to the 'scripts' directory (we will use these after compilation to launch simulations)
cp -r python ~/scripts

# Configure and compile the erk_waves project

# Change directory to the build location
cd ~/lib
# Configure
ccmake ../src

# Configuration steps:
# Change CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE from 'Debug' to 'Release' (optional but should speed up runtime)
# Type 'c' to configure 'e' to exit
# You should now see that 'Chaste_ENABLE_project_erk_wave' has been added to the options
# Type 'c' to configure again 'e' to exit and 'g' to generate

# Now compile the code required for running erk_waves simulations
make TestERKWaveWithSelfPropulsionNoAlignment
# make TestERKWaveWithSelfPropulsionWithAlignment

# Launch simulation runs using the python scripts provided
cd ~/scripts/python
pip install numpy
python batch_erk_propulsion_no_alignment.py

# You should a clock running and simulation output should appear in the location ~/testoutput/

# See these instructions for copying data in and out or alternatively to save test output to the host during runtime:
https://github.com/Chaste/chaste-docker?tab=readme-ov-file#sharing-data-between-the-host-and-container

# E.g. to copy from container to host, with the docker container open in one terminal, in another terminal type the following to find the container ID (you may need to use sudo)
docker ps
# Replace <container_ID> in the following command with this ID in order to copy the testoutput directory from the container to your current location on the host
docker cp <container_ID>:/home/chaste/testoutput .
# You can then use ParaView to open results.pvd files (results_from_time_xxxx/results.pvd or .vtu files) locally on your machine
